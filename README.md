# Xnode
Xnode facilitates quick and painless prototyping, experimenting, and sharing through a platform built by researchers,
 for researchers.
 
 ## Requirements
  - Sandboxes must be run with Python 3.7+, as our code uses data classes.
  - The `wrapt` package must be installed for whatever Python environment is used, as it is used by `graphtracker.py`.
