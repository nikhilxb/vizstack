    On creation, the `ExecutionManager` starts a new process and a new thread. The new process runs `execute.run_script()`,

    watch expressions are added to a queue. The thread reads this queue, printing any schemas to stdout as they are
    added. Client programs, such as `repl.js`, can read these printed schemas.

    The thread is necessary to prevent blocking; otherwise, the engine would either have to block until script execution
    is done, preventing re-runs, or schemas would only be output after the process completes, which would produce long
    delays in longer scripts. The subprocess cannot write to stdout itself, so the thread must do so instead.

    Once the user-written script has executed, `execute.run_script()` waits for the user to request the data objects of
    additional symbols. Those requests are sent from `repl.js` to stdin, and then sent to the `ExecutionManager`, which
    adds the request to a queue that is read by `execute.run_script()`.
